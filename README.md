# CSFundamentals

A repo of my notes restudying my Computer Science Fundamentals.  I've definitely forgotten a lot since graduating, but to keep myself sharp, I want to document and store my notes on GitHub.

I want to maintain a growth mindset - even I didn't know many of these things yesterday, I'm glad I know them today!
